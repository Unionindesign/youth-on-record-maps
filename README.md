Youth On Record is Denver Non-Profit whose mission is to empower youth through creative education. I have been involved with Youth on Record for several years, both as a musician and data analyst. In the fall of 2019 I approached them about building an interactive map to showcase their community impact, ultimately to use this data to help secure future contracts and grant funding.

The map, built with ReactJS and Mapbox, has a temporary home on Heroku while I work with website partner [Elevated Third](https://www.elevatedthird.com/) to integrate into their Drupal website. Live Workshop Map: https://lit-ocean-77747.herokuapp.com/

In addition, this map will be expanded to include data on partner artists and music ambassadors - traveling, international artists who donate concert proceeds or material goods and equipment. This will be a global map, with many bands and artists stopping through Denver for concerts as they travel the globe, and gracing the Denver Youth Media Studio with live performances, recordings, and interviews.

This intitiative has grown into a larger project of organizing their data into a PostgreSQL database, currently under construction, and ultimately a Python app to use image recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to scan their pre and post student surveys and push to the database, making reporting easily accessibly to board members to help in securing funding.

The code to do so is open-sourced here: https://github.com/Unionindesign/YouthOnRecord

I believe it is important to share this code in case someone else out there would like to take on an endeavor like this for another non-profit who does not have the means or technical know-how to organize their data, and use it for data-driven reporting which is so vital to the survival of non-profit organizations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
